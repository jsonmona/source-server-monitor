## Valve Server Monitor

A simple monitoring application for game servers using Valve Source Engine Query.

This program is NOT for testing Steam store server!

It is tested with [Space Engineers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/244850), but it should work with most games in
theory.

### Usage
`python main.py (address) (port)`
Check the address and port.

`python main.py -c`
Load address and port from `config.json`, and check it.
